#helloplanet

> HelloDao's first metaverse game, allowing members with virtual identities to land in space to explore extraterrestrial planets and become the first interstellar immigrants.
>
> Hello Planet will be rolled out in phases over 5 years. Hello Planet is characterized by its respect for the future, describing the metaverse through rigorous logic and cosmology, and at the same time focusing on the exploration experience of the cosmic economy, allowing users to work, do business, and survive in the virtual world, and interpret the metaverse more deeply.

## story background

> In 2065, human beings began to colonize Mars on a large scale, and human beings entered the era of interstellar economy. Therefore, early entry into the Mars city, land development, agriculture and business has become the largest capital fast lane. A large number of businessmen and practitioners began to book interstellar ferry tickets to live in the new world.
>
> However, tickets to the new world are so rare that the few spacecraft in the world, even if they carry passengers every day, can only transport a few passengers to Mars. Most people will stay on earth forever. So humans began to study and explore to remotely control robots or other species on Mars through virtual reality equipment, so as to carry out "interstellar migration" in spirit and thought.
>
> The birth of the new world and the transformation of the old world gradually formed a sharp contrast. But war and looting will always be themes of human existence. The struggle for the right to develop resources on Mars and the replacement of the dominance of species on Earth. The old and new worlds converged in the next few hundred years, opening a new chapter for the destiny of mankind.

## Game Chapter

> Through different chapters, the development forms of the metaverse in different periods are presented to players. The game will also develop a mainline and independent forks due to different chapters.

### Interstellar

- Combination of virtual and real: exploration

  - Machine Pioneer

    > In order to ensure that human beings can survive well on Mars, a team of robots first landed on Mars and started city construction. These robots can link with VR equipment on Earth and receive commands.

  - Ape inhabitants

    > Mars becomes more dangerous as more robots are attacked and destroyed by unknown creatures. Those aboriginal people have the same characteristics as the apes of the earth, but they display amazing strength, the robots made by humans are simply unable to resist their attacks, and the cities under construction are destroyed on a large scale.

  - War Dogs

    > The first war dogs to be genetically engineered by humans and combined with mechanical devices, they are robust and powerful. Humans expect war dogs to stabilize the situation and find out where the Martian ape lives.
    
  - Bear-like

    > Those bears that were tamed by Martian apes (so called because of their resemblance to Earth's bears) survived the dog's powerful weapons and bites unscathed, and their hard coats resisted any damage.

  - new humans

    > The deterrence of the war dog to the Martian ape made humans see the power of genetic modification, and the fanatical organization ignored the pressure of public opinion and cultivated a new human with powerful fighting genes. Some of these new humans were sent to Mars on missions, and some remained on Earth as secret weapons. New humans may be the only way to defeat the Martian bears.
